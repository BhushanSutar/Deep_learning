# ðŸŽ¬ IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Classification (Simple RNN)  
This project implements a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** to classify IMDB movie reviews into **positive** and **negative** categories. It demonstrates how sequential models can capture sentiment patterns in text using the **TensorFlow/Keras** framework. The trained model (`simple_rnn_imdb.h5`) is included for quick predictions.
